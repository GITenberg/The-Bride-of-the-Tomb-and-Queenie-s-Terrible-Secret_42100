description: In the first story, hours before her wedding, lovely Lily Lawrence takes
  her own life. But through a series of unusual clues, it soon becomes clear that
  all is not as it seems. The mystery veers into fantastical territory that will surprise
  even the most attentive reader. Queenie's Terrible Secret offers a glimpse into
  the inner world of Queenie, who is much more than the spoiled debutante she appears
  to be.
